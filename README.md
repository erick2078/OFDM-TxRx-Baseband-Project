# 🎉 OFDM-TxRx-Baseband-Project - Easy OFDM Simulation for Everyone

## 🚀 Getting Started
Welcome to the OFDM-TxRx-Baseband-Project! This application helps you simulate Optical Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) for transmitters and receivers using MATLAB. It covers essential parts of digital communication, such as Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT), Cyclic Prefix (CP), and equalization methods. This project is made for anyone interested in learning about digital signal processing.
